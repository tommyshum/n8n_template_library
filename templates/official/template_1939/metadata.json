  "description": "This workflow sends the contents of an email to a Notion database. The email must be labeled with a specific label for the workflow to trigger. The email subject will be the title of the Notion page, and a snippet of the email body will be the content of the Notion page. The email link will be added to the Notion page as a property.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNotion account and Notion credentials.\nGoogle account and Google credentials.\n\nHow it works\n\nOn scheduled intervals, find all emails with a specific label. For each email, check if the email already exists in the Notion database. If it does not exist, create a new page in the Notion database, otherwise do nothing. When the task in the Notion database is checked off, the label will be removed from the email.\n\nSetup\n\nThis workflow requires that you set up a Notion database or use an existing one with at least the following fields:\n\nTitle (title)\nThread ID (text)\nEmail thread (URL)\n\nAdditionally, create a label that will be used to trigger the workflow in Gmail. In this workflow, the label is called \"Notion\".",
