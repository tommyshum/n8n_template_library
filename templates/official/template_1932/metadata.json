  "description": "This template shows how you can take any event from any service, transform its data and send an alert to your desired app. \n\nSpecifically, this example monitors a Linear project for new bug submissions. Then it only sends a Slack notification to a channel if a new bug is urgent. You can swap the Linear trigger for another Task Management app such as Jira or Asana; or an entirely different usecase.\n\nSetup instructions are located inside the workflow template. ",
