The source file is taken from the European Open Data Portal:\nhttps://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/veranstaltungsplaetze-potsdam-potsdam?locale=en\n\nThe binary data is then imported via the Spreadsheet File node and converted to Excel format.\n\nN.B. Note that as of version 1.23.0 n8n, the Spreadsheet File node has been redesigned and is now called Convert to File node.
