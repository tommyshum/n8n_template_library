  "name": "Automate Customer Support Issue Resolution using AI Text Classifier",
  "description": "This n8n template is designed to assist and improve customer support team member capacity by automating the resolution of long-lived and forgotten JIRA issues.\n\nHow it works\n\nSchedule Trigger runs daily to check for long-lived unresolved issues and imports them into the workflow.\nEach Issue is handled as a separate subworkflow by using an execute workflow node. This allows parallel processing.\nA report is generated from the issue using its comment history allowing the issue to be classified by AI - determining the state and progress of the issue.\nIf determined to be resolved, sentiment analysis is performed to track customer satisfaction. If negative, a slack message is sent to escalate, otherwise the issue is closed automatically.\nIf no response has been initiated, an AI agent will attempt to search and resolve the issue itself using similar resolved issues or from the notion database. If a solution is found, it is posted to the issue and closed.\nIf the issue is blocked and waiting for responses, then a reminder message is added.\n\nHow to use\n\nThis template searches for JIRA issues which are older than 7 days which are not in the \"Done\" status. Ensure there are some issues that meet this criteria otherwise adjust the search query to suit.\nWorks best if you frequently have long-lived issues that need resolving.\nEnsure the notion tool is configured as to not read documents you didn't intend it to ie. private and/or internal documentation.\n\nRequirements\n\nJIRA for issues management\nOpenAI for LLM\nSlack for notifications\n\nCustomising this workflow\n\nWhy not try classifying issues as they are created? One use-case may be for quality control such as ensuring reporting criteria is adhered to, summarising and rephrasing issue for easier reading or adjusting priority.",
