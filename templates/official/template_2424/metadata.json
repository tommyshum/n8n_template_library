  "description": "Adobe developer API\n\nDid you know that Adobe provides an API to perform all sort of manipulation on PDF files : \n\nSplit PDF, Combine PDF\nOCR\nInsert page, delete page, replace page, reorder page\nContent extraction (text content, tables, pictures)\n...\n\nThe free tier allows up to 500 PDF operation / month. As it comes directly from Adobe, it works often better than other alternatives.\n\nAdobe documentation: \n\nhttps://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-services-api/howtos/\nhttps://developer.adobe.com/document-services/docs/overview/pdf-extract-api/gettingstarted/\n\nWhat does this workflow do\n\nThe API is a bit painful to use. To perform a transformation on a PDF it requires to \n\nAuthenticate and get a temporal token\nRegister a new asset (file)\nUpload you PDF to the registered asset\nPerform a query according to the transformation requested\nWait for the query to be proccessed by Adobe backend\nDownload the result\n\nThis workflow is a generic wrapper to perform all these steps for any transformation endpoint. I usually use it from other workflow with an Execute Workflow node.\n\nExamples are given in the workflow.\n\nExample use case\n\nThis service is useful for example to clean PDF data for an AI / RAG system. \n\nMy favorite use-case is to extract table as images and forward images to an AI for image recognition / description which is often more accuarate than feedind raw tabular data to a LLM.",
