  "description": "Purpose of workflow:\nThe purpose of this workflow is to automate  scraping of a website, transforming it into a structured format, and loading it directly into a Google Sheets spreadsheet. \n\nHow it works:\n\nWeb Scraping: Uses the Jina AI service to scrape website data and convert it into LLM-friendly text.\nInformation Extraction: Employs an AI node to extract specific book details (title, price, availability, image URL, product URL) from the scraped data.\nData Splitting: Splits the extracted information into individual book entries.\nGoogle Sheets Integration: Automatically populates a Google Sheets spreadsheet with the structured book data.\n\nStep by step setup:\n\nSet up Jina AI service:\n   Sign up for a Jina AI account and obtain an API key.\n\n\nConfigure the HTTP Request node:\n   Enter the Jina AI URL with the target website.\n   Add the API key to the request headers for authentication.\n\nSet up the Information Extractor node:\n   Use Claude AI to generate a JSON schema for data extraction.\n   Upload a screenshot of the target website to Claude AI.\n   Ask Claude AI to suggest a JSON schema for extracting required information.\n   Copy the generated schema into the Information Extractor node.\n\nConfigure the Split node:\n   Set it up to separate the extracted data into individual book entries.\n\nSet up the Google Sheets node:\n   Create a Google Sheets spreadsheet with columns for title, price, availability, image URL, and product URL.\n   Configure the node to map the extracted data to the appropriate columns.\n",
