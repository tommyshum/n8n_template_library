  "description": "This simple workflow demonstrates how to get an end user's browser to download a file. It makes use of the Content-Disposition header to set a filename and control the browser behaviour.\n\n\n\nA use case could be the download of a PDF file at the end of an application process or to export data from a database without replacing the current page content in the browser.\n\nWith this approach, the current page remains open and the file is simply downloaded instead:\n\n\n\nThe original idea was first present here by @dickhoning in the n8n community.",
