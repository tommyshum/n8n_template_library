  "description": "\n\nCommunity Node Disclaimer: As this workflow relies on a community node, it is limited to self-hosted environments.\n\nHow It Works:  \n\nJotform Webinar Registry Integration: This workflow streamlines the process of handling webinar registrations submitted via JotForm. It ensures the data is correctly formatted and seamlessly integrates with KlickTipp.  \nData Transformation: Input data is validated and transformed to meet KlickTipp’s API requirements, including formatting phone numbers, converting dates, and validating URLs.  \n\nKey Features  \n\nJotForm Trigger:  \nCaptures new form submissions, including participant details and webinar preferences.  \n\nData Processing:  \nStandardizes and validates input fields  \nConverts phone numbers to numeric-only format with international prefixes.  \nTransforms dates into UNIX timestamps.  \nValidates LinkedIn URLs and applies fallback URLs if validation fails.  \nScales numerical fields, such as work experience, for specific use cases.  \n\nSubscriber Management in KlickTipp:  \nAdds or updates participants as subscribers in KlickTipp.  \nIncludes custom field mappings, such as:  \n\tPersonal information (name, email, phone number).  \n\tWebinar details (chosen webinar, start date/time).  \n\tPreferences (reminder intervals, questions for presenters).\nTags contacts for segmentation: Adds fixed and dynamic tags to contacts.\n  \n\nError Handling:  \nValidates critical fields like phone numbers, URLs, and dates to prevent incorrect data submissions.  \n\nSetup Instructions  \n\nInstall and Configure Nodes:  \nSet up the JotForm and KlickTipp nodes in your n8n instance.  \nAuthenticate your JotForm and KlickTipp accounts.  \n\nCustom Field Preparation in KlickTipp:  \nCreate the necessary custom fields to match the data structure:  \n\n| Name | Datentyp |\n| - | - |\n| Jotform_URL_Linkedin | URL |\n| Jotform_Workexperience_in_Years | Dezimalzahl |\n| Jotform_Webinar_start_timestamp | Datum & Zeit |\n| Jotform_Questions/Notes | Absatz |\n| Jotform_webinar | Zeile |\n| Jotform_reminder | Zeile |  \n\nAfter creating fields, allow 10-15 minutes for them to sync. If fields don’t appear, reconnect your KlickTipp credentials.  \n\nField Mapping and Adjustments:  \nVerify and customize field assignments in the workflow to align with your specific form and subscriber list setup.  \n\nWorkflow Logic  \n\nTrigger via JotForm Submission: A new form submission from JotForm initiates the workflow  \nData Transformation: Processes raw form data to ensure compatibility with KlickTipp’s API.  \nAdd to KlickTipp Subscriber List: Adds participants to the designated KlickTipp list, including webinar-specific details.  \nGet all tags from KlickTipp and create a list:\nFetches all existing Tags and turns them into an array\n\nDefine tags to dynamically set for contacts: Definiton of variables that are received from the form submission and should be converted into tags\n\nMerge tags of both lists: Checks whether the list of existing tags in KlickTipp contains the tags which should be dynamically set based on the form submission\n\nTag creation and tagging contacts: Creates new tags if it previously did not exist and then tags the contact\n\n\n\nBenefits  \n\nEfficient lead generation: Contacts from forms are automatically imported into KlickTipp and can be used immediately, saving time and increasing the conversion rate.  \nAutomated processes: Experts can start workflows directly, such as welcome emails or course admissions, reducing administrative effort.  \nError-free data management: The template ensures precise data mapping, avoids manual corrections and reinforces a professional appearance.  \n\nTesting and Deployment:  \n\nTest the workflow by filling the form on Jotform and verifying data updates in KlickTipp.  \n\nNotes:  \n\nCustomization: Update field mappings within the KlickTipp nodes to align with your account setup.
