  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates an approach to image embeddings for purpose of building a quick image contextual search. Use-cases could for a personal photo library, product recommendations or searching through video footage.\n\nHow it works\nA photo is imported into the workflow via Google Drive.\nThe photo is processed by the edit image node to extract colour information. This information forms part of our semantic metadata used to identify the image.\nThe photo is also processed by a vision-capable model which analyses the image and returns a short description with semantic keywords.\nBoth pieces of information about the image are combined with the metadata of the image to form a document describing the image.\nThis document is then inserted into our vector store as a text embedding which is associated with our image.\nFrom here, the user can query the vector store as they would any document and the relevant image references and/or links should be returned.\n\nRequirements\nGoogle account to download image files from Google Drive.\nOpenAI account for the Vision-capable AI and Embedding models.\n\nCustomise this workflow\n\nText summarisation is just one of many techniques to generate image embeddings. If the results are unsatisfactory, there are dedicated image embedding models such as Google's vertex AI multimodal embeddings.",
