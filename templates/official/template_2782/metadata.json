  "description": "Workflow Overview  \nThis workflow automates the creation and management of a custom OpenAI Assistant for a travel agency (\"Travel with us\"), leveraging Google Drive for document storage.\n\nHow It Works  \n\n1. Create the OpenAI Assistant  \nNode**: OpenAI  \n  Action: Creates a custom assistant named \"Travel with us\" Assistant using the gpt-4o-mini model.  \n  Instructions:  \n    Respond only using the provided document (e.g., agency-specific info).  \n    Stay friendly, brief, and focused on travel-related queries.  \n    Ignore irrelevant questions politely.  \n  Credentials: Requires OpenAI API key.  \n\n2. Upload Agency Document  \nGoogle Drive Node**:  \n  Action: Downloads a Google Doc as a PDF.   \nOpenAI2 Node**:  \n  Action: Uploads the PDF to OpenAI with purpose: \"assistants\".  \n  Output: Generates a file_id.  \n\n3. Update the Assistant with the Document  \nOpenAI Node**:  \n  Action: Updates the assistant to include the uploaded file.\n\n4. Chat Interaction  \nChat Trigger**:  \n  Activates when a message is received (\"When chat message received\").  \nOpenAI Assistant Node**:  \n  Action: Uses the updated assistant to respond to user queries.  \n  Memory: Window Buffer Memory retains chat context for coherent conversations.  \n\nSet Up Steps  \nPrepare the Document:  \n   Store your travel agency guide in Google Drive (e.g., as a Google Doc).  \n   Update the Google Drive node with your document’s ID.  \n\nConfigure Credentials:  \n   Google Drive: Connect via OAuth2 (googleDriveOAuth2Api).  \n   OpenAI: Add your API key to all OpenAI nodes.  \n\nCustomize the Assistant:  \n   Modify the instructions in the OpenAI node to reflect your agency’s needs.  \n   Ensure the document includes FAQs, policies, and travel info.  \n\nTest the Workflow:  \n   Trigger manually (\"Test workflow\") to create the assistant and upload the file.  \n   Send a chat message (e.g., \"What are your travel packages?\") to test responses.  \n\nDependencies  \nGoogle Drive Account**: To store and retrieve the agency document.  \nOpenAI API Access**: For assistant creation and file uploads.
