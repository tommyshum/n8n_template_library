  "description": "Who is this template for?\n\nThis template is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and automation enthusiasts who want to streamline their GitLab merge request process using n8n, a low-code workflow automation tool. It eliminates manual intervention by automating the merging of GitLab branches through API calls.\n\nHow it works ?\n\nTrigger the workflow: The workflow can be triggered by a webhook, a scheduled event, or a GitLab event (e.g., a new merge request is created or approved).\n\nFetch Merge Request Details: n8n makes an API call to GitLab to retrieve merge request details.\n\nCheck Merge Conditions: The workflow validates whether the merge request meets predefined conditions (e.g., approvals met, CI/CD pipelines passed).\n\nPerform the Merge: If all conditions are met, n8n sends a request to the GitLab API to merge the branch automatically.\n\nSetup Steps\n\n1. Prerequisites\n\nAn n8n instance (Self-hosted or Cloud)\n\nA GitLab personal access token with API access\n\nA GitLab repository with merge requests enabled\n\n2. Create the n8n Workflow\n\nSet up a trigger: Choose a trigger node (Webhook, Cron, or GitLab Trigger).\n\nFetch merge request details: Add an HTTP Request node to call GET /merge_requests/:id from GitLab API.\n\nValidate conditions:\n\nCheck if the merge request has necessary approvals.\n\nEnsure CI/CD pipelines have passed.\n\nMerge the request:\n\nUse an HTTP Request node to call PUT /merge_requests/:id/merge API.\n\n3. Test the Workflow\n\nCreate a test merge request.\n\nCheck if the workflow triggers and merges automatically.\n\nDebug using n8n logs if needed.\n\n4. Deploy and Monitor\n\nDeploy the workflow in production.\n\nUse n8nâ€™s monitoring features to track execution.\n\nThis template enables seamless GitLab merge automation, improving efficiency and reducing manual work!\n\nNote: \nNever hard code API token or secret in your https request.",
