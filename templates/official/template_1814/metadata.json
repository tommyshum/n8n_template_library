  "description": "This is a workflow that might come handy after using loops. They usually leave you with items spread across different \"runs\". The Code node in this example workflow merges them into a single run, so you have a single list of items which is often easier to work with.\n\nSimply adjust the node name inside the Code node as needed.\n\nThe idea is based on this older workflow template.",
