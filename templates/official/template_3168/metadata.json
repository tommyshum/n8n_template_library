You can customize it as needed.  \n\nhelpfulcrowd  \nThis sheet follows the format from this HelpfulCrowd guide, with a slight modification: an added review_id column to support the upsert process.  \n\nOnce the workflow is complete, export the sheet as a CSV and upload it to HelpfulCrowd. For detailed steps, see this post.  \n\nRunning the Workflow  \nYou can trigger the workflow on-demand or schedule it to run at a set interval.  \n\nRequirements  \nTrustpilot business name** (e.g., n8n.io in https://www.trustpilot.com/review/n8n.io).
