  "description": "This workflow demonstrates how to use noItemsLeft to check if there are items left to be processed by the SplitInBatches node.\n\n\n\nFunction node: This node generates mock data for the workflow. Replace it with the node whose data you want to split into batches.\n\nSplitInBatches node: This node splits the data with the batch size equal to 1. Based on your use-case, set the value of the Batch Size.\n\nIF node: This node check if all the data by the SplitInBatches are not processed or not. It uses the expression {{$node[\"SplitInBatches\"].context[\"noItemsLeft\"]}} which returns a boolean value.\nIf there is data yet to be processed, the expression will return false, otherwise true.\n\nSet node: This node prints a message No Items Left. Based on your use-case, connect the false output of the IF node to the input of the node you want to execute, after the data is processed by the SplitInBatches node.",
