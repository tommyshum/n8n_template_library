  "name": "Adaptive RAG Strategy with Query Classification & Retrieval (Gemini & Qdrant)",
  "description": "This n8n workflow implements a version of the Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework. It recognizes that the best way to retrieve information often depends on the type of question asked. Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, this workflow adapts its strategy based on the user's query intent.\n\nüåü How it Works\n\nReceive Query: Takes a user query as input (along with context like a chat session ID and Vector Store collection ID if used as sub-workflow).\nClassify Query: First, the workflow classifies the query into a predefined category. This template uses four examples:\n    Factual: For specific facts.\n    Analytical: For deeper explanations or comparisons.\n    Opinion: For subjective viewpoints.\n    Contextual: For questions relying on specific background.\nSelect & Adapt Strategy: Based on the classification, it selects a corresponding strategy to prepare for information retrieval. The example strategies aim to:\n    Factual: Refine the query for precision.\n    Analytical: Break the query into sub-questions for broad coverage.\n    Opinion: Identify different viewpoints to look for.\n    Contextual: Incorporate implied or user-specific context.\nRetrieve Info: Uses the output of the selected strategy to search the specified knowledge base (Qdrant vector store - change as needed) for relevant documents.\nGenerate Response: Constructs a response using the retrieved documents, guided by a prompt tailored to the original query type.\n\nBy adapting the retrieval strategy, this workflow aims to provide more relevant results tailored to the user's intent.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Usage & Flexibility\n\nSub-Workflow:** Designed to be called from other n8n workflows, passing user_query, chat_memory_key, and vector_store_id as inputs.\nChat Testing:** Can also be triggered directly via the n8n Chat interface for easy testing and interaction.\nCustomizable Framework:** The query categories (Factual, Analytical, etc.) and the associated retrieval strategies are examples. You can modify or replace them entirely to fit your specific domain or requirements.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Requirements\n\nCredentials:** You will need API credentials configured in your n8n instance for:\n    Google Gemini (AI Models)\n    Qdrant (Vector Store)",
