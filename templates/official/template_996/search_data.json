  "description": "This workflow demonstrates how to use currentRunIndex to get the running index.\n\n\n\nFunction node: This node generates mock data for the workflow. Replace it with the node whose data you want to split into batches.\n\nSplitInBatches node: This node splits the data with the batch size equal to 1. Based on your use-case, set the value of the Batch Size.\n\nIF node: This node checks the running index. If the running index equals 5 the node returns true and breaks the loop.\nThe node uses the expression {{$node[\"SplitInBatches\"].context[\"currentRunIndex\"];}}, which returns the running index.\n\nSet node: This node prints a message Loop Ended. Based on your use-case, connect the false output of the IF node to the input of the node you want to execute if the condition is false.\n",
