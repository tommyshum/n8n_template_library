  "description": "This workflow allows you to send SMS messages globally using API without needing a physical phone number. \n\n1. How It Works\n\nConsists of three main nodes:\n\nManual Trigger**: The workflow starts when you click the \"Test workflow\" button in n8n.\nSet SMS Data**: This node defines the SMS message content and the recipient's phone number (including the international prefix).\nSend SMS**: This node sends the SMS using the ClickSend API. It uses HTTP Basic Authentication with your ClickSend credentials and sends a POST request to the ClickSend API endpoint with the message and recipient details.\n\nThe workflow is simple and efficient, making it easy to automate SMS sending for various use cases, such as notifications, alerts, or marketing campaigns.\n\n2.
