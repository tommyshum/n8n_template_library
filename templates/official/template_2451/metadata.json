  "description": "\nThis workflow downloads all files from a specific folder in a S3 Bucket and compresses them so you can download it via n8n or do further processings.\n\nFill in your Credentials and Settings in the Nodes marked with \"*\".\n\nMight serve well as Blueprint or as manual Download for S3 Folders. \n\nSince I found it rather tricky to compress all binary files into one zip file I figured might it be an interesting Template. \n\nHint:\nThis is the expression to get every binary key to compress them dynamically. \n(used in the \"Compress\"-Node)\n\n\nEnjoy the Workflow! ‚ù§Ô∏è \nhttps://let-the-work-flow.com\nWorkflow Automation & Development",
