It converts any Reddit thread into a polished video with:\nTTS narration\nSubtitle overlays\nB-roll from Pexels\nAutomatic rendering via Shotstack\n\nWhat this workflow does\n\nThis workflow:\nExtracts Reddit post and comments via Reddit API\nSummarizes the thread into structured clips using OpenAI\nGenerates search queries for each clip for stock footage\nQueries Pexels API for relevant vertical videos\nGenerates TTS audio for each clip using OpenAI Whisper\nCreates subtitles matching the audio\nUploads footage/audio to Shotstack\nRenders a full vertical video (720x1280) with synced TTS, subtitles, and b-roll\nReturns a final video URL\n\nSetup\n\nCreate accounts and API keys for:\n  Reddit Developer App\n  OpenAI\n  Pexels\n  Shotstack\nAdd credentials in n8n:\n  Reddit (HTTP Basic Auth)\n  OpenAI (API Key)\n  Shotstack (HTTP Header Auth)\n  Pexels (HTTP Header Auth)\nTrigger via webhook or manual node. The input must include:\n    {\n    \"voice\": \"nova\",\n    \"ttsSpeed\": 1,\n    \"videoLength\": 60,\n    \"redditLink\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/example/comments/example_id/example_title\"\n  }\nHow to customize this workflow\n\nTweak OpenAI prompts** to change tone or clip granularity\nChange stock source** by swapping Pexels for another API\nAdjust TTS voices** or languages by modifying the voice field\nModify video styling** (fonts, colors, fit modes) in the timeline construction code node\nControl duration** by editing the character length formula in the Limit comments length node\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nAll stock videos are selected to match clip themes using generalized keywords to avoid API misses\nIncludes wait nodes to ensure Shotstack's async upload/render processes complete before proceeding\nAnnotated with sticky notes explaining major sections like TTS, Reddit input, and media timeline\nAvoids community nodes to ensure cloud compatibility\n\nTemplate Category\nAI, Marketing, Building Blocks, Other (Content Creation)\n",
