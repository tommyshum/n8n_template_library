  "description": "This template integrates OpenAI's image generation and editing endpoints via the GPT-Image-1 model to visually create and manipulate images based on prompts. It features base64 conversion, binary handling, and prompt chaining.\n\nPerfect for marketing, design, product visuals and creative workflows.\n\nüõ†Ô∏è Requirements\nOpenAI account with access to gpt-image-1(probably you need organizations verifications for access to that model)\n\nOpenAI API credentials configured in n8n\n\nA self-hosted or cloud n8n instance\n\nBasic familiarity with the n8n UI (no programming required)\n\nüîß Step-by-step Instructions\n\nStep 1: Manual Trigger\nStarts the workflow on click. Ideal for testing the generation and edit logic.\n\nStep 2: Generate Image\nThe Create image call node sends a prompt to OpenAI and returns a base64 image.\n\nExample prompt:\n\nA cyberpunk city at night with flying cars and neon lights\n\nStep 3: Convert to Binary\nThe base64 image is converted into a usable binary PNG file with the Convert json binary to File node.\n\nStep 4: Edit the Image\nThe binary file is passed to OpenAI‚Äôs /images/edits endpoint. A new prompt applies changes to the image.\n\nExample:\n\nAdd a glowing robot in the foreground with a neon sword\n\n‚úÖ Supports model: gpt-image-1\n‚ö†Ô∏è Requires binary file (not base64)\n\nStep 5: Final Conversion\nConverts the final edited image from base64 to file so it can be downloaded or used in other nodes.\n\nüéØ Real-World Use Cases\nüé® Artists & Creators: concept art and illustration variations\n\nüõçÔ∏è E-commerce: auto-generate product mockups\n\nüì∞ Marketing: create eye-catching blog or social visuals\n\nüí° Bonus Ideas\nAdd a Telegram or Slack node to generate or edit images via chat\n\nUse a Webhook to feed prompts from a form or frontend\n\nAdd a mask to restrict edits to specific areas (e.g., background only)\n\n\n",
