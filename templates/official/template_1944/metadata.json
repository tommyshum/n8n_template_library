  "description": "This workflow compares 2 datasets from a single database.\n\nTwo SQL nodes create a slightly different summary report based on the payments table.\n\nBoth reports have the same structure, but different time periods. In addition to that, output from the \"Orders from 2004 and 2005\" node has an extra manipulation on the ordercount variable.\n\nThis makes Compare Datasets node to produce four outputs: data in A Only Branch, in B Only Branch, Same Branch records and Different Branch records.\n\nPlease refere to the MySQL Tutorial website and download the example database: https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx",
