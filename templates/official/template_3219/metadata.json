  "description": "This workflow helps you generate an llms.txt file (if you're unfamiliar with it, check out this article) using a Screaming Frog export.  \n\nScreaming Frog is a well-known website crawler.  \nYou can easily crawl a website. Then, export the \"internal_html\" section in CSV format.  \n\nHow It Works: \n\nA form allows you to enter:  \nThe name of the website  \nA short description  \nThe internal_html.csv file from your Screaming Frog export  \n\n\nOnce the form is submitted, the workflow is triggered automatically, and you can download the llms.txt file directly from n8n. \n\nDownloading the File\nSince the last node in this workflow is \"Convert to File\", you will need to download the file directly from the n8n UI.  \nHowever, you can easily add a node (e.g., Google Drive, OneDrive) to automatically upload the file wherever you want.  \n\nAI-Powered Filtering (Optional):  \nThis workflow includes a text classifier node, which is deactivated by default.  \nYou can activate it to apply a more intelligent filter to select URLs for the llms.txt file.  \nConsider modifying the description in the classifier node to specify the type of URLs you want to include.  \n\nHow to Use This Workflow  \n\nCrawl the website you want to generate an llms.txt file for using Screaming Frog.  \nExport the \"internal_html\" section in CSV format.  \n     \nIn n8n, click \"Test Workflow\", fill in the form, and upload the internal_html.csv file.  \nOnce the workflow is complete, go to the \"Export to File\" node and download the output.  \n\nThat's it! You now have your llms.txt file!  \n\n\n\nRecommended Usage:  \nUse this workflow directly in the n8n UI by clicking 'Test Workflow' and uploading the file in the form.",
