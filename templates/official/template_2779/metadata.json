  "description": "What this workflow does\nMonitors Google Drive: The workflow triggers whenever a new CSV file is uploaded.\nUses AI to Identify PII Columns: The OpenAI node analyzes the data and identifies PII-containing columns (e.g., name, email, phone).\nRemoves PII: The workflow filters out these columns from the dataset.\nUploads Cleaned File: The sanitized file is renamed and re-uploaded to Google Drive, ensuring the original data remains intact.\n\nHow to customize this workflow to your needs\nAdjust PII Identification: Modify the prompt in the OpenAI node to align with your specific data compliance requirements.\nInclude/Exclude File Types: Adjust the Google Drive Trigger settings to monitor specific file types (e.g., CSV only).\nOutput Destination: Change the folder in Google Drive where the sanitized file is uploaded.\n\nSetup\nPrerequisites:\nA Google Drive account.\nAn OpenAI API key.\nWorkflow Configuration:\nConfigure the Google Drive Trigger to monitor a folder for new files.\nConfigure the OpenAI Node to connect with your API\nSet the Google Drive Upload folder to a different location than the Trigger folder to prevent workflow loops.",
