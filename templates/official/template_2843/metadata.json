  "description": "Automate Sports Betting Data with TheOddsAPI  \n\nThis workflow enables you to create and update a table using TheOddsAPI for sports betting data. It automatically pulls upcoming Ice Hockey games at the start of the day and updates the table with results at the end of the day. You can modify it to retrieve odds and game data for any sport.  \n\nThis setup is particularly useful for sports betting applications, such as tracking the results of a predictive model. It leverages scheduled triggers to activate HTTP requests, which then create or update fields in Airtable by matching on the game ID.  \n\nPrerequisites  \n\nBefore implementing this workflow, ensure you have the following:  \n\nTheOddsAPI Account & API Key  \n   Sign up at TheOddsAPI and obtain an API key.  \n   Ensure you have the correct API permissions to access sports odds and results.  \n\nAirtable Account & API Key  \n   Create an account at Airtable and set up a database.  \n   Obtain an API key from the Account Settings page.  \n\nAPI Access & Rate Limits  \n   Review TheOddsAPIâ€™s rate limits and ensure your account tier allows for scheduled API calls.  \n   Confirm that Airtable API limits align with your expected data retrieval frequency.  \n\nStep-by-Step Guide to Integrating TheOddsAPI  \n\n1. Schedule API Requests  \nSet up a trigger to automatically pull upcoming Ice Hockey games at the start of each day.  \n\n2. Fetch Data from TheOddsAPI  \nRetrieve the latest sports betting data, including game details and odds, using TheOddsAPI.  \n\n3. Store Data in Airtable  \nInsert or update records in Airtable by matching game IDs, ensuring data accuracy.  \n\nSample Airtable Template Column Setup for Ice Hockey  \n(Table can adjust depending on sport and data needs.
