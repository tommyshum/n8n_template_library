Don't ever skip this step. Ever.\nSet it and forget it.\n\n&gt; NOTE\nYou can replace the Wordpress node with another website CMS node, or generic HTTP request for a non-wordpress site.\nYou can also remove or replace the Slack node with other notification functionality (eg. sms, whatsapp, email...)\n\nTemplate was created in n8n v1.58.2\n",
