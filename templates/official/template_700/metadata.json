  "description": "This workflow is useful if you have lots of tasks running daily.\n\nMySQL node (or the database used to save data shown in n8n - could be Mongo, Postgres, ... -) remove old entries from execution_entity table that contains the history of the executed workflows.\n\n\n\nIf you have multiple tasks executed every minute, 1024 rows will be created every day (60 minutes x 24 hours) per every task. This will increase the table size fastly.\n\nSQL query deletes entries older than 30 days taking stoppedAt column as a reference for date calculations.\n\n\n\nYou only have to setup Mysql connection properly and config cron to execute once per day in a low traffic hour, this way\n\n",
