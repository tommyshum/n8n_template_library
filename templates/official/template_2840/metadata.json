  "description": "n8n Workflow: Automate SIEM Alert Enrichment with MITRE ATT&CK & Qdrant  \n\nWho is this for?  \nThis workflow is ideal for:  \nCybersecurity teams & SOC analysts* who want to automate *SIEM alert enrichment**.  \nIT security professionals* looking to integrate *MITRE ATT&CK intelligence** into their ticketing system.  \nOrganizations using Zendesk for security incidents* who need enhanced *contextual threat data**.  \nAnyone using n8n and Qdrant* to build *AI-powered security workflows**.  \n\nWhat problem does this workflow solve?  \nSecurity teams receive large volumes of raw SIEM alerts that lack actionable context. Investigating every alert manually is time-consuming and can lead to delayed response times. This workflow solves this problem by:  \n‚úî Automatically enriching SIEM alerts with MITRE ATT&CK TTPs.  \n‚úî Tagging & classifying alerts based on known attack techniques.  \n‚úî Providing remediation steps to guide the response team.  \n‚úî Enhancing security tickets in Zendesk with relevant threat intelligence.  \n\nWhat this workflow does  \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Ingests SIEM alerts (via chatbot or ticketing system like Zendesk).  \n2Ô∏è‚É£ Queries a Qdrant vector store containing MITRE ATT&CK techniques.  \n3Ô∏è‚É£ Extracts relevant TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, & Procedures) from the alert.  \n4Ô∏è‚É£ Generates remediation steps using AI-powered enrichment.  \n5Ô∏è‚É£ Updates Zendesk tickets with threat intelligence & recommended actions.  \n6Ô∏è‚É£ Provides structured alert data for further automation or reporting.  \n\nSetup Guide  \n\nPrerequisites  \nn8n instance** (Cloud or Self-hosted).  \nQdrant vector store** with MITRE ATT&CK data embedded.  \nOpenAI API key** (for AI-based threat processing).  \nZendesk account** (for ticket enrichment, if applicable).  \nClean Mitre Data Python Script\nCleaned Mitre Data\nFull Mitre Data\n\nSteps to Set Up  \n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Embed MITRE ATT&CK data into Qdrant  \n   This workflow pulls MITRE ATT&CK data from Google Drive and loads it into Qdrant.  \n   The data is vectorized using OpenAI embeddings for fast retrieval.  \n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the n8n Chatbot  \n   The chatbot listens for SIEM alerts and sends them to the AI processing pipeline.  \n   Alerts are analyzed using an AI agent trained on MITRE ATT&CK.  \n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Enrich Zendesk Tickets  \n   The workflow extracts MITRE ATT&CK techniques from alerts.  \n   It updates Zendesk tickets with contextual threat intelligence.  \n   The remediation steps are included as internal notes for SOC teams.  \n\nHow to Customize This Workflow  \n\nüîß Modify the chatbot trigger: Adapt the chatbot node to receive alerts from Slack, Microsoft Teams, or any other tool.  \n\nüîß Change the SIEM input source: Connect your workflow to Splunk, Elastic SIEM, or Chronicle Security.  \n\nüîß Customize remediation steps: Use a custom AI model to tailor remediation responses based on organization-specific security policies.  \n\nüîß Extend ticketing integration: Modify the Zendesk node to also work with Jira, ServiceNow, or another ITSM platform.  \n\nWhy This Workflow is Powerful  \n‚úÖ Saves time: Automates alert triage & classification.  \n‚úÖ Improves security posture: Helps SOC teams act faster on threats.  \n‚úÖ Leverages AI & vector search: Uses LLM-powered enrichment for real-time context.  \n‚úÖ Works across platforms: Supports n8n Cloud, Self-hosted, and Qdrant.  \n\nüöÄ Get Started Now!  \nüìñ Watch the Setup Video  \nüí¨ Have Questions?
