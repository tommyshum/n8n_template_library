This should give you a URL like this {{$n8nhostingurl/webhook/ea568868-5770-4b2a-8893-700b344c995e?Website=https://mailsafi.com\nClick on the URL and wait for the extracted email to be displayed. \nThis will return the email address on the website, or if there is no email, the response will be \"workflow successfully executed.\"\n\nMake sure to use HTTP:// for your domains\n\nOtherwise, you may get an error. \n\n\n\n",
