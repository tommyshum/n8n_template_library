  "name": "Conversational Interviews with AI Agents and n8n Forms",
  "description": "This n8n template combines an AI agent with n8n's multi-page forms to create a novel interaction which allows automated question-and-answer sessions. One of the more obvious use-cases of this interaction is what I'm calling the AI interviewer.\n\nYou can read the full post here: https://community.n8n.io/t/build-your-own-ai-interview-agents-with-n8n-forms/62312\n\nLive demo here: https://jimleuk.app.n8n.cloud/form/driving-lessons-survey\n\nHow it works\n\nA form trigger is used to start the interview and a new session is created in redis to capture the transcript.\nAn AI agent is then tasked to ask questions to the user regarding the topic of the interview. This is setup as a loop so the questions never stop unless the user wishes to end the interview.\nEach answer is recorded in our session set up earlier between questions.\nWhen the user requests to end the interview we break the loop and show the interview completion screen.\nFinally, the session is then saved in a Google Sheet which can then be shared with team members and for the purpose of data analysis.\n\nHow to use\n\nYou'll need to be on a n8n instance that is accessible to your target audience. Not technical enough to setup your own server? Try out n8n cloud and instantly deploy template!\nRemember to activate the workflow so the form trigger is published and available for users to use.\n\nRequirements\nGroq LLM for AI agent. Feel free to swap this out for any other LLM.\nRedis(-compatible) storage for capturing sessions\n\nCustomising this workflow\n\nThe next step would be adding tools! AI interviews with knowledge retrieval could definitely open up other possibilities. Eg. An onboarding wizard generating questions by pulling facts from internal knowledgebase.\n",
