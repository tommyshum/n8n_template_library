  "description": "Purpose\nThis workflow enables you to listen to your recent favorites in very hight quality offline without sacrificing all of your storage.\n\nHow it works\nThis workflow automatically creates a playlist in Spotify named \"Downloads\" which periodically gets updated so it always contains only a defined amount of the latest liked songs.\n\nThis enables only the Downloads playlist to set for automatic downloading and thus free up space on the device.\n\nSetup\nThe workflow is ready to go. Just select your Spotify credentials and activate the workflow.\nIn Spotify just enable automatic downloads on the automatically created Downloads folder after the first workflow run.\n\nCurrent limitations\nThis setup currently supports a maximum of 50 songs in the Downloads Playlist. This is due to the paylod limits defined by Spotify encountered in the Get liked songs node. Implementing batching would solve the issue.",
