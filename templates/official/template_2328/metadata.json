  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how you can summarise and automate post-meeting actions from video transcripts fed into an AI Agent.\n\nSave time between meetings by allowing AI handle the chores of organising follow-up meetings and invites.\n\nHow it works\nThis workflow scans for the calendar for client or team meetings which were held online. * Attempts will be made to fetch any recorded transcripts which are then sent to the AI agent.\nThe AI agent summarises and identifies if any follow-on meetings are required.\nIf found, the Agent will use its Calendar Tool to to create the event for the time, date and place for the next meeting as well as add known attendees.\n\nRequirements\nGoogle Calendar and the ability to fetch Meeting Transcripts (There is a special OAuth permission for this action!)\nOpenAI account for access to the LLM.\n\nCustomising the workflow\n\nThis example only books follow-on meetings but could be extended to generate reports or send emails.",
