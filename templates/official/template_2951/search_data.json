  "description": "This n8n workflow template is designed to help system administrators and DevOps professionals monitor key resource usage metrics ‚Äî CPU, RAM, and Disk ‚Äî on a VPS (Virtual Private Server). The workflow automatically checks these resources every 15 minutes and sends an email alert if any resource usage exceeds the 80% threshold. This proactive monitoring helps maintain optimal server performance and prevents resource-related downtimes.\n\nWho This Workflow Is For\n\n‚Ä¢ System Administrators managing Linux-based servers who need to ensure their systems are running smoothly without manual monitoring.\n‚Ä¢ DevOps Professionals who manage multiple environments and need automated tools to alert them to potential issues before they affect operations.\n ‚Ä¢ IT Support Teams who require an easy way to keep tabs on server health across an organization‚Äôs infrastructure.\n\nHow It Works\nSchedule Trigger: The workflow is triggered every 15 minutes by a Cron node.\nResource Checks: Separate SSH Command nodes are configured to execute specific commands that check the current usage of RAM, Disk, and CPU.\nData Aggregation: The results from each check are merged using a Merge node, which combines the data into a single payload for analysis.\nThreshold Analysis: A Function node evaluates whether any resource‚Äôs usage exceeds the predefined 80% threshold.\nAlerts: If any metric exceeds the threshold, an email alert is sent through an Email node, ensuring that administrators can react promptly to potential issues.\n\nSetup Steps\nConfigure SSH Nodes: Update each SSH node with the appropriate credentials and target server details where the resource checks will be performed.\nSet Thresholds: If different sensitivity levels are required, review and adjust the resource usage thresholds within the Function node.\nEmail Configuration: Enter the correct email addresses in the Email node for where alerts should be sent. Ensure that your email-sending credentials and server details are correctly configured.",
