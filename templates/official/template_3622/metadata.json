This node serves as the entry point to the full automation.\n\nüîπ Field Mapping & Pre-Processing\nA series of basic logic nodes map and clean up the input fields. These are then passed to an LLM Chain to generate specific questions related to the job description.\n\nüîπ Question Answer Chain + Vector Search (Pinecone)\nUsing your previously stored skills and project data in a Pinecone vector store, the system retrieves relevant information to answer the generated questions and builds a rich context around the job description.\n\nüîπ AI Agent Node ‚Äì Generate Personalized Cover Letter\nWith both the job post and contextual data, the AI Agent (powered by Groq‚Äôs Qwen LLM) creates a tailored cover letter.  \nThe agent is equipped with:\n\nüîç Google Search Tool  \nüß† Vector Store Retriever Tool  \nüóÉÔ∏è Buffer Memory  \n\nThis ensures the generated proposal is insightful, relevant, and professional.\n\nüîπ Markdown to HTML ‚Äì Clean Output Conversion\nThe markdown output from the AI is converted into HTML using a Markdown node, making it easy to paste directly into Upwork or emails.\n\nüîπ Return to Shortcut ‚Äì Display Final Result\nThe final HTML response is sent back to the MacOS Shortcut, which displays it in a modal window for easy review and copy-paste.\n\nüíº Use Case\n\nThis automation is built specifically for freelancers on Upwork (or any freelance platform) who want to:\n\n‚úÖ Save time on repetitive proposal writing  \n‚úÖ Create job-specific cover letters with context  \n‚úÖ Stand out with better personalization  \n‚úÖ Reduce manual effort with automation  \n\nWhether you‚Äôre a beginner or a seasoned pro, this tool elevates your workflow while staying simple to use.\n\nüì¶ Setup Instructions\n\nImport Workflow to your n8n instance  \nCreate and Configure MacOS Shortcut (drag-and-drop ready)  \nPrepare and Embed Your Skills/Project Data into Pinecone  \nAdd API Credentials:\n   Groq (for Qwen LLM)  \n   Pinecone  \n   n8n Webhook (Basic Auth if needed)  \nRun the Workflow & Submit Smarter Proposals\n\n&gt; Note: This workflow is designed for building and returning Upwork cover letters using job descriptions copied to your clipboard. All generation is context-aware and tailored per submission.\n",
