  "description": "This workflow allows you to send position updates of the ISS every minute to a queue using the AWS SQS node.\n\n\n\nCron node: The Cron node will trigger the workflow every minute.\n\nHTTP Request node: This node will make a GET request to the API https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544/positions to fetch the position of the ISS. This information gets passed on to the next node in the workflow.\n\nSet node: We will use the Set node to ensure that only the data that we set in this node gets passed on to the next nodes in the workflow.\n\nAWS SQS: This node will send the data from the previous node to the iss-position queue. If you have created a queue with a different one, you can use that queue instead.",
