  "description": "Do you consistently forget to set a Default Error Workflow when creating new workflows?  Then this helper workflow is for you!\n\nWhen activated, this helper workflow will:\nScan ALL other workflows every 4 hours\nMake sure ALL workflows have a default error workflow set (based on what Workflow ID you provide)\nThis helper will SKIP OVER any workflows that have the default_error:false tag set (make sure your default error workflow has the default_error:false tag set, so that you don't end up with recursive loops during errors)\n\nSetup Nodes:\nOnce imported, edit the Set Vars node with your default_error_workflow_id value.\nIf you want to change the default_error:false tag to some other tag name, you can do so here as well.\nYou need to update the Set Default Error Workflow node with your PostgreSQL credentials to access the n8n database.",
