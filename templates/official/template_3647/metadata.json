  "description": "Automatically convert documents from Google Drive into vector embeddings using OpenAI, LangChain, and PGVector ‚Äî fully automated through n8n.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What It Does\n\nThis workflow monitors a Google Drive folder for new files, supports multiple file types (PDF, TXT, JSON), and processes them into vector embeddings using OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-small model. These embeddings are stored in a Postgres database using the PGVector extension, making them query-ready for semantic search or RAG-based AI agents.\n\nAfter successful processing, files are moved to a separate ‚Äúvectorized‚Äù folder to avoid duplication.\n\nüí° Use Cases\n\nPowering Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI agents  \nSemantic search across private documents  \nAI assistant knowledge ingestion  \nAutomated document pipelines for indexing or classification  \n\nüß† Workflow Highlights\n\nTrigger Options:** Manual or Scheduled (3 AM daily by default)  \nSupported File Types:** PDF, TXT, JSON  \nEmbedding Stack:** LangChain Text Splitter, OpenAI Embeddings, PGVector  \nDeduplication:** Files are moved after processing  \nLicense:** CC BY-SA 4.0  \nAuthor:** AlexK1919\n\nüõ† What You‚Äôll Need\n\nGoogle Drive OAuth2** credentials (connected to Search Folder, Download File, and Move File nodes)  \nOpenAI API Key** (used in the Embeddings OpenAI node)  \nPostgres + PGVector** database (connected in the Postgres PGVector Store node)\n\nüîß Step-by-Step Setup Instructions\n\nCreate Google OAuth2 credentials in n8n and connect them to all Google Drive nodes.\nSet your source folder ID in the Search Folder node ‚Äî this is where incoming files are placed.\nSet your processed folder ID in the Move File node ‚Äî files will be moved here after vectorization.\nEnsure you have a PGVector-enabled Postgres instance and input the table name and collection in the Postgres PGVector Store node.\nAdd your OpenAI credentials to the Embeddings OpenAI node and select text-embedding-3-small.\nOptional: Activate the Schedule Trigger node to run daily or configure your own schedule.\nRun manually by triggering When clicking ‚ÄòTest workflow‚Äô for on-demand ingestion.\n\nüß© Customization Tips\n\nWant to support more file types or enhance the pipeline?\n\nAdd new extractors**: Use Extract from File with other formats like DOCX, Markdown, or HTML.\nRefine logic by file type**: The Switch node routes files to the correct extraction method based on MIME type (application/pdf, text/plain, application/json).\nPre-process with OCR**: Add an OCR step before extraction to handle scanned PDFs or images.\nAdd filters**: Enhance the Search Folder or Switch node logic to skip specific files or folders.\n\nüìÑ License\n\nCreative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0)  \nUse, adapt, and share - even commercially - as long as you give proper credit and share alike.  \nFull License Details\n",
