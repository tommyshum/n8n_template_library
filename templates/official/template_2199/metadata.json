This n8n workflow addresses a simple problem: how to maintain consistency in your publications on X.\n\n📋 Blog post\n📺 Youtube Video\n\n\nThe workflow is direct and to the point.\n\nIn a Google spreadsheet, write all your tweets, one tweet per line.\n\nThen, at a defined pace (for example, every 6 hours), the workflow will publish the first tweet from the list on your X account and remove it from the sheet.\n\nThis method is really simple but very efficient if you are looking for a direct and super fast solution to share regularly on X!\n\n\n\nCreated by the n8ninja.",
