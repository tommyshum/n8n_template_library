  "description": "üë• Who Is This For?  \nContent creators, marketing teams, and channel managers who want a simple, hands‚Äëoff solution to upload videos and automatically generate optimized metadata from video transcripts.\n\nüõ† What Problem Does This Solve?  \nManual video uploads with proper metadata creation is time‚Äëconsuming and repetitive. This workflow fully automates:  \nMonitoring a specific Google Drive folder for new video uploads  \nSeamless YouTube upload processing  \nTranscript extraction for context understanding  \nAI‚Äëpowered generation of titles, descriptions, and tags  \nMetadata application to uploaded videos without manual intervention  \n\nüîÑ Node‚Äëby‚ÄëNode Breakdown  \n| Step | Node Purpose                                                        |\n|------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 1    | New Video? (Trigger) ‚Äì Monitors specified Google Drive folder       |\n| 2    | Download New Video ‚Äì Retrieves the video file from Google Drive     |\n| 3    | Upload to YouTube ‚Äì Uploads the video to YouTube with initial settings |\n| 4    | Get Transcript ‚Äì Extracts transcript from the uploaded video        |\n| 5    | Adjust Transcript Format ‚Äì Formats raw transcript for processing    |\n| 6    | Create Description ‚Äì Generates SEO‚Äëoptimized description            |\n| 7    | YT Tags (Message Model) ‚Äì Creates relevant tags based on content    |\n| 8    | YT Title (Message Model) ‚Äì Generates compelling title               |\n| 9    | Define File Path Upload Format (Optional) ‚Äì Structures data paths   |\n| 10   | Update Video‚Äôs Metadata ‚Äì Applies generated title, description, tags|\n\n‚öôÔ∏è Pre‚Äëconditions / Requirements  \nn8n with Google Drive and YouTube API credentials configured (stored as n8n credentials/variables; no hard‚Äëcoded IDs)  \nDedicated Google Drive folder for video uploads  \nYouTube channel with proper upload permissions  \nAI service access for transcript processing and metadata generation  \nSufficient storage for temporary video handling  \n\n‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions  \nImport this workflow into your n8n instance.  \nConfigure Google Drive credentials; reference folder ID via n8n variable (do not hard‚Äëcode).  \nSet up YouTube API credentials with upload and edit permissions.  \nSpecify the target Google Drive folder ID in the New Video? trigger node (via variable).  \nConfigure AI service credentials for transcript and metadata generation.  \nAdjust message templates for title, description, and tag creation.  \nTest with a small video file before production use.  \n\nüé® How to Customize  \nModify AI prompts to match your channel‚Äôs tone and style.  \nAdd conditional logic based on video categories or naming conventions.  \nImplement notification systems to alert when uploads complete.  \nCreate custom metadata templates for different content types.  \nInclude timestamps or chapter markers based on transcript analysis.  \nAdd social media sharing nodes to announce new uploads.  \n\n‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes  \nVideo quality is preserved through the upload process.  \nConsider YouTube API quotas when handling multiple uploads.  \nTranscript quality affects metadata generation results.  \nVideos are initially uploaded without visibility adjustments.  \nProcessing time depends on video length and transcript complexity.  \n\nüîê Security and Privacy  \nStore API credentials and folder IDs as n8n Credentials/Variables‚Äîremove any hard‚Äëcoded tokens or IDs.  \nVideo files are processed temporarily and not stored permanently.  \nLimit Google Drive folder access to authorized users only.  \nManage YouTube upload permissions carefully (use OAuth/service accounts).  \nEnsure compliance with organizational data‚Äëhandling policies.  \n\n",
