  "description": "Disclaimer: This template only works on self-hosted for now, as it uses a community node.\n\nUse Case\nWeb scrapers often break due to web page layout changes.\nThis workflow attempts to mitigate this problem by auto-generating web scraping data extractor code via LLM.\n\nHow It Works\nThis workflow leverages ScrapeNinja n8n community node to: \nscrape webpage HTML, \nfeed it into LLM (Google Gemini) and ask to write a JS extractor function code, then it \nexecutes the written JS extractor against scraped HTML to extract useful data from webpage (the code is safely executed in a sandbox)\n\nInstallation\nTo install ScrapeNinja n8n node, in your self-hosted instance, go to Settings -&gt; Community nodes, enter \"n8n-nodes-scrapeninja\", and install. \n\nMake sure you are using at least v0.3.0. \n\nSee this in action:\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7289659870935490560/\n\n",
