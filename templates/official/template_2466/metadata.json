  "description": "This n8n template demonstrates the beginnings of building your own n8n-powered WhatsApp chatbot! Under the hood, utilise n8n's powerful AI features to handle different message types and use an AI agent to respond to the user. A powerful tool for any use-case!\n\nHow it works\nIncoming WhatsApp Trigger provides a way to get messages into the workflow.\nThe message received is extracted and sent through 1 of 4 branches for processing.\nEach processing branch uses AI to analyse, summarize or transcribe the message so that the AI agent can understand it. The supported types are text, image, audio (voice notes) and video.\nThe AI Agent is used to generate a response generally and uses a wikipedia tool for more complex queries.\nFinally, the response message is sent back to the WhatsApp user using the WhatsApp node.\n\nHow to use\nOnce you have setup and configured your WhatsApp account, you'll need to activate your workflow to start processing messages.\n\nGood to know: Large media files may negatively impact workflow performance.\n\nRequirements\nWhatsApp Buisness account\nGoogle Gemini for LLM. Gemini is used specifically because it can accept audio and video files whereas at time of writing, many other providers like OpenAI's GPT, do not.\n\nCustomising this workflow\nFor performance reasons, consider detecting large audio and video before sending to the LLM. Pre-processing such files may allow your agent to perform better.\nGo beyond and create rich and engagement customer experiences by responding using images, audio and video instead of just text!",
