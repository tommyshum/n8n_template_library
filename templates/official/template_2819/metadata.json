  "description": "Use Case\nIt is very convenient to add expenses via simple chat message. This workflow attempts to do exactly this using AI-powered n8n magic!\n\n\nSend message to a chat, something like \"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"\n\nAnd get a response:\nYour expense saved, here is the output of save sub-workflow:{\"cost\":59.3,\"descr\":\"car wash\",\"date\":\"2024-01-25\",\"msg\":\"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"}\n\n\nLLM will smartly parse your message to structured JSON and save the expense as a new row into Google Sheet!\n\nInstallation\n1. Set up Google Sheets:\nClone this Sheet:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1D0r3tun7LF7Ypb21CmbTKEtn76WE-kaHvBCM5NdgiPU/edit?gid=0#gid=0\n\n(File -&gt; Make a copy)\n\nChoose this sheet into \"Save expense into Google Sheets\" node.\n\n2. Fix sub-workflow dropdown: \nopen \"Parse msg and save to Sheets\" node (which is an n8n sub-workflow executor tool) and make sure the SAME workflow is chosen in the dropdown. it will allow n8n to locate and call \"Workflow Input Trigger\" properly when needed.\n\n3. Activate the workflow to make chat work properly.\nSent message to chat, something like \"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"\n\nyou should get a response:\nYour expense saved, here is the output of save sub-workflow:{\"cost\":59.3,\"descr\":\"car wash\",\"date\":\"2024-01-25\",\"msg\":\"car wash; 59.3 usd; 25 jan 2024\"}\n\nand new row in Google sheets should be inserted!\n",
