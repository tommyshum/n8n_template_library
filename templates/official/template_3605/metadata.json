  "description": "Gmail MCP Server\nExpose Gmail’s full API as a single SSE “tool server” endpoint for your AI agents.\n\nWhat it does\nSpins up an MCP Trigger that streams Server‑Sent Events to LangChain/N8N AI Agent nodes. ​\n\nMaps 20+ common Gmail operations (search, send, reply, draft, label & thread management, mark read/unread, delete, etc.) to ai_tool connections, so agents can invoke them with a simple JSON payload. \n\nWhy you’ll love it\nAgent‑ready: Plug the SSE URL into any N8N Agent or any other AI tool that uses MCP and start reasoning over email immediately.\n\nExtensible: Add more GmailTool operations or swap credentials without touching your agent logic.\n\nHow to use\nImport the workflow (n8n ≥ v1.88).\n\nSet up a gmailOAuth2 credential and select it on the GmailTool nodes.\n\nOpen the Gmail MCP Server node, copy the SSE URL, and paste it into your AI agent’s “Tool Server” field.\n",
