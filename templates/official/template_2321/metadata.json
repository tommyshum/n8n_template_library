  "description": "This n8n workflow demonstrates how to automate oftern time-consuming form filling tasks in the early stages of the tendering process; the Request for Proposal document or \"RFP\".\n\nIt does this by utilising a company's knowledgebase to generating question-and-answer pairs using Large Language Models.\n\nHow it works\nA buyer's RFP is submitted to the workflow as a digital document that can be parsed.\nOur first AI agent scans and extracts all questions from the document into list form.\nThe supplier sets up an OpenAI assistant prior loaded with company brand, marketing and technical documents.\nThe workflow loops through each of the buyer's questions and poses these to the OpenAI assistant.\nThe assistant's answers are captured until all questions are satisified and are then exported into a new document for review.\nA sales team member is then able to use this document to respond quickly to the RFP before their competitors.\n\nExample Webhook Request\n\ncurl --location 'https://&lt;n8n_webhook_url&gt;' \\\n--form 'id=\"RFP001\"' \\\n--form 'title=\"BlueChip Travel and StarBus Web Services\"' \\\n--form 'reply_to=\"jim@example.com\"' \\\n--form 'data=@\"k9pnbALxX/RFP Questionnaire.pdf\"'\n\nRequirements\nAn OpenAI account to use AI services.\n\nCustomising the workflow\n\nOpenAI assistants is only one approach to hosting a company knowledgebase for AI to use. Exploring different solutions such as building your own RAG-powered database can sometimes yield better results in terms of control of how the data is managed and cost.",
