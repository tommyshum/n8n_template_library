  "description": "Store a key with a value in a local json file. Multiple keys could be saved in a single file.\n\nRelated workflow: GetKey\n\nCreate a subfolder in your n8n homedir: /home/node/.n8n/local-files. In docker look at the data path and create a subfolder local-files.\nSet the correct access rights chmod 1000.1000 local-files.\n\nPut the workflow code in a new workflow named WriteKey.\n\nCreate another workflow with a function item:\n\nreturn  {\n  file: '/4711.json', // 4711 should be your workflow id\n  key: 'MyKey',\n  value: 'MyValue'\n}\n\nPipe the function item to an Execution Workflow that calls the WriteKey workflow.\n\nIt would be nice if we could get someday a shiny built-in n8n node that does the job. :)",
