  "description": "What it is-\nI wanted to create a simple, easy-to-use, MCP server for your Discord bot(s).\n\nHow to set up-\nLiterally all you do is select your bot auth (or crease a new Discord Bot auth if you havn't entered your key in n8n before) and that's IT!\n\nHow to use it-\nYou can now ask your bot to do things via any MCP client, including from within N8N workflows!\n\nNote:\nIf you need an example, you can check out my simple quickstart Discord MCP Server that uses 4o to send messages to channels on your server and users who are members of the server the bot is in.",
