Website Scraping for Additional Information\nFor businesses with websites but missing email addresses, the workflow visits their homepage\nExtracts email addresses using regular expressions for more complete contact information\nFilters out irrelevant emails using configurable patterns\n\n5. Data Cleaning and Organization\nRemoves duplicate contact information and standardizes data format\nFilters results based on your specific requirements for contact details\nSaves all extracted data to Google Sheets for easy access and management\n\nSetup\n\n1. Configure Your Queries:\nOpen the \"Run Workflow\" node and input your list of queries\nFormat queries with outer area, inner area, and keyword (e.g., \"California,Los Angeles,real estate\")\n\n2. Optimize Tag Targeting:\nAfter initial runs, identify the specific tags used by your target industry\nUpdate the HTTP Request node with these specific tags to improve result quality\nCommon tags include \"office\", \"shop\", and \"amenity\" with industry-specific values\n\n3.
