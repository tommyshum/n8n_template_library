  "description": "This workflow takes a text file as input. It pulls the information from the text file and used it as a parameter to execute a command for each text line.\n\nThis workflow references a file /home/n8n/filelist.txt in the Read Binary File node which will need to be changed to work properly. You can also edit the Execute Command node to modify what happens for each of these lines of text.\n\n\n\nNote: This workflow requires the Execute Command node which is only available on the on-premise version of n8n.",
