  "description": "This n8n template shows how anyone can build a simple newsletter-like subscription service where users can enrol themselves to receive messages/content on a regular basis. It uses n8n forms for data capture, Airtable for database, AI for content generation and Gmail for email sending.\n\nHow it works\nAn n8n form is setup up to allow users to subscribe with a desired topic and interval of which to recieve messages via n8n forms which is then added to the Airtable.\nA scheduled trigger is executed every morning and searches for subscribers to send messages for based on their desired intervals.\nOnce found, Subscribers are sent to a subworkflow which performs the text content generation via an AI agent and also uses a vision model to generate an image.\nBoth are attached to an email which is sent to the subscriber. This email also includes an unsubscribe link.\nThe unsubscribe flow works similarly via n8n form interface which when submitted disables further scheduled emails to the user.\n\nHow to use\nMake a copy of sample Airtable here: https://airtable.com/appL3dptT6ZTSzY9v/shrLukHafy5bwDRfD\nMake sure the workflow is \"activated\" and the forms are available and reachable by your audience.\n\nRequirements\nAirtable for Database\nOpenAI for LLM (but compatible with others)\nGmail for Email (but can be replaced with others)\n\nCustomising this workflow\nThis simple use can be extended to deliver any types of content such as your company newsletter, promotions, social media posts etc.\nDoesn't have to be limited to just email - try social messaging, Whatsapp, Telegram and others.",
