  "description": "How it works\n\nThis workflow automates the backup of all your n8n workflows to a specified Google Drive folder. It operates in two main phases:\n\nOrchestration (Scheduled Task):\n    The workflow is initiated by a Schedule Trigger (e.g., daily at 1:30 AM by default).\n    It then uses an n8n API Node to fetch a list of all existing workflows in your n8n instance.\n    A Loop Over Items node processes each fetched workflow individually.\n    For every workflow in the list, an Execute Workflow node calls the \"worker\" part of this same workflow, passing the individual workflow's data.\n\nIndividual Workflow Backup (Worker Task):\n    This part is triggered by the When Executed by Another Workflow node (called by the orchestrator part).\n    It first retrieves the passed workflow data.\n    A Parameters node defines the target Google Drive directory.\n    The Get Google Drive File Data node searches the specified Google Drive folder to see if a backup file for the current workflow (named as WorkflowName_WorkflowID.json) already exists.\n    An IF Node (ifDriveEmpty) checks the result:\n        If a backup file exists, the workflow data is converted to a binary JSON file using a Code Node, and then the existing file on Google Drive is updated (Backup to Google Drive2).\n        If a backup file does not exist, the workflow data is first formatted as JSON, converted to a binary JSON file using another Code Node, and then uploaded as a new file to Google Drive (Backup to Google Drive4).\n    If any Google Drive upload/update operation fails, a Failure Email is sent.\n\nAfter the loop in the orchestration phase completes (all workflows processed), a Limit node ensures only one signal proceeds to send a Success Email and a Discord message indicating the overall backup process was completed.\n\nSetup\n\nClone Workflow: Clone this workflow into your n8n environment.\nCredentials:\n    n8n API: In the \"Get all n8n Workflows\" node, select or create n8n API credentials. This allows the workflow to list all your other workflows.\n    Google Drive: In the \"getDriveFileData\", \"Backup to Google Drive2\", and \"Backup to Google Drive4\" nodes, select or create your Google Drive OAuth2 API credentials.\n    Gmail: In the \"successEmail\" and \"failureEmail\" nodes, select or create your Gmail credentials.\n    Discord (Optional): If you wish to use Discord notifications, configure your Discord Bot API credentials in the \"Discord\" node.\nConfiguration:\n    Schedule: Open the \"Schedule Trigger\" node and adjust the trigger interval (e.g., time of day) as needed.\n    Google Drive Folder: Open the \"Parameters\" node (connected after \"Workflow Data\"). Edit the directory value to the full URL of the Google Drive folder where you want to store your backups (e.g., https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID).\n    Email Recipients: Open the \"successEmail\" and \"failureEmail\" nodes and update the \"Send To\" field with your desired recipient email address(es).\n    Discord Channel (Optional): If using Discord, open the \"Discord\" node and set the \"Channel ID\" for notifications.\n    Sub-Workflow ID: The \"Execute Workflow\" node is pre-configured to call this workflow itself using its ID. If you import this workflow and its ID changes, you may need to update the workflowId in the \"Execute Workflow\" node to the new ID of this imported workflow. However, n8n usually handles this if it's self-referential within the same imported workflow.\n\nHow to use\n\nActivate: After completing the setup steps, activate the workflow. It will automatically run according to the defined schedule.\nManual Execution: You can also manually trigger the workflow by clicking the \"Execute Workflow\" play button on the \"Schedule Trigger\" node to perform an immediate backup of all workflows.\nCheck Backups: Your n8n workflows will be saved as .json files (named WorkflowName_WorkflowID.json) in the Google Drive folder you specified in the \"Parameters\" node.\nNotifications: You will receive an email (and optionally a Discord message) upon successful completion of the entire backup process, or individual failure emails if a specific workflow backup to Google Drive fails.\n\nAuthor & Credits\n\nCreator:** Hochien Chang\nYouTube Channel (Chinese):** HC AI說人話\nYouTube Channel (English):** HC HumanizeAI\nOriginal Explanation Video:** https://youtu.be/PA15H5qunC0\nBased on:** n8n Workflow Backup to Google Drive\n\n",
