  "description": "üë§ Who is this for?  \nThis workflow is designed for Scrum Masters, Agile Coaches, and Product Owners who want to automate backlog refinement preparation using Google Sheets, Gmail, and OpenAI. It‚Äôs ideal for teams seeking consistent, high-quality refinement sessions with minimal manual effort.\n\nüß© What problem is this workflow solving?  \nMany Agile teams struggle with unprepared refinement sessions, unclear user stories, and inconsistent feedback. This workflow solves that by automating the selection, validation, and communication process‚Äîsaving time while improving backlog quality and team alignment.\n\n‚öôÔ∏è What this workflow does  \nThe workflow checks the Scrum Master‚Äôs Google Calendar for an upcoming refinement event. It then pulls potential user stories from a Google Sheets backlog, filters them by status, and validates them using OpenAI agents for Scrum, business, and technical feedback. Finally, it compiles everything into a structured HTML email, either creating a draft or sending it upon approval.\n\nüöÄ Setup  \nUse consistent event naming in Google Calendar  \nConfigure environment variables for your project (e.g., sheet names, statuses)  \nConnect your own backlog and Definition of Ready  \nCustomize the AI prompts and email layout\n\nüõ†Ô∏è How to customize this workflow to your needs  \nReplace Google Sheets with Jira or Airtable  \nSwitch Gmail to Outlook, SMTP, or Mailgun  \nExtend error handling or approval logic  \nTailor the email tone and AI prompts to match your team\n\nüî• Unique Selling Points (USPs)\nAI-Powered Multi-Perspective Feedback\nAutomated Definition of Ready (DoR) Checks\nCalendar-Aware Triggering\nFully Formatted Gmail Emails, With Approval Flow\nPlug-and-Play Customizability\n\n",
