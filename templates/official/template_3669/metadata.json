  "description": "This Workflow streamlines the process of publishing posts (image or video) to multiple social media platforms using a unified form and a third-party API service called Upload-Post.\n\nThe automation starts with a form trigger, allowing users to submit content (text and media) through a simple frontend interface. Users select the platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, TikTok, Threads), choose the profile name, write a caption, and upload a photo or video.\n\nHow It Works  \nAutomates cross-platform social media posting via Upload-Post, handling both images (JPEG) and videos (MP4). Here’s the process:  \n\nTrigger**:  \n  A form submission captures user inputs:  \n    Platform (Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, TikTok, Threads).  \n    Account (pre-configured profile name).  \n    Caption and file (image/video).  \n    Optional Facebook Page ID for targeted posting.  \n\nRouting**:  \n  The \"Video or Photo?\" Switch node checks the file’s MIME type:  \n    Image: Routes to the \"Post photo\" HTTP node (uploads via upload_photos API).  \n    Video: Routes to the \"Post video\" HTTP node (uploads via upload API).  \n\nAPI Integration**:  \n  Both nodes send data to Upload-Post.com’s API, including:  \n    Caption, account name, platform, and file binary.  \n    Facebook ID (if provided).  \n\nSuccess/Failure Handling**:  \n  The \"Result Photo/Video\" nodes parse the API response.  \n\nSetup Steps  \n\nPrerequisites:  \nUpload-Post.com API Key**:  \n  Get it from the API Keys dashboard.  \n  Free tier allows 10 uploads/month.  \n\nConfiguration:  \nAPI Authentication:  \n   In the HTTP Request nodes (Post photo/Post video), set the Authorization header:  \n     Name: Authorization  \n     Value: Apikey YOUR_API_KEY_HERE.  \n\nForm Customization:  \n   Adjust the \"On form submission\" node to:  \n     Add/remove platforms (e.g., YouTube when approved).  \n     Modify file type restrictions (default: .jpg, .mp4).  \n\nAccount Mapping:  \n   Ensure the \"Account\" field matches profiles configured in Upload-Post.com (e.g., test1, test2).  \n\nFacebook Page Integration:  \n   Optional: Add a Facebook Page ID field for page-specific posts.  \n\nTesting:  \n   Submit test forms with images/videos.  \n   Verify API responses and success/failure messages.  \n\nOptional Enhancements:  \nAdd error logging (e.g., save failed attempts to a database).  \nExtend to YouTube once API support is confirmed.  \n\nKey Features:  \nMulti-Platform**: Post to 6+ social networks simultaneously.  \nUser-Friendly**: Simple form interface for non-technical users.  \nError Handling**: Clear feedback for success/failure cases.  \n\nNeed help customizing?  \nContact me for consulting and support or add me on Linkedin.
