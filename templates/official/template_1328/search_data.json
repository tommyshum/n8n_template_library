  "description": "This workflow looks for a Close Date value using REGEX in the IF node. If it finds the correct value, it will pass that value on. If it does not find the correct value, it will generate a value based on the present time plus three weeks.\n\nThe final result will show up in the NoOps node.\n\nYou can text this execution by enabling and disabling the Set node when you run the execution.",
