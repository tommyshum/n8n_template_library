  "description": "The Stripe API does not provide custom fields in invoice or charge data. So you have to get it from the Checkout Sessions endpoint.\n\nBut that endpoint is not easy for begginners. It has dictionary parameters and pagination settings.\n\nThis workflows solves that problem by having a preconfigured GET request that gets all the checkout sessions from the last 7 days.\n\nIt then transforms the data to make it easier to work with and allows you to filter by the custom_fields you want to get.\n\nWant to generate Stripe invoices automatically?\n\nOpen ðŸ‘‰ this workflow\n.\n\nCheck out my other templates\nhttps://n8n.io/creators/solomon/",
