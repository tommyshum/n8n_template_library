  "description": "Problem\nTeams often struggle with email overload, leading to missed actions and inefficient meeting preparation.\n\nSolution\nThis workflow automates email management using n8n and AI. It fetches emails, summarizes key points and actions, and sends two concise updates—one in the morning and one at night.\n\nHow It Works\n\nTriggers at 7 AM and 9 PM: Automates the process to summarize emails received during specific time blocks.\n\nFetches Emails: Retrieves emails from the last 24 hours or after a specific time.\n\nSummarizes with AI: Uses OpenAI to process the email content into actionable summaries.\nSends Team Updates: Compiles the summaries into a concise, formatted email and sends it to the team.\n\nExpected Results\nSignificant reduction in missed actions and follow-ups. \n\nCustomizations\nAdjust timings, filters, and recipients to suit your team’s needs.",
