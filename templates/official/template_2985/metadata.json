  "description": "AI-Powered Chatbot Workflow with MySQL Integration\n\nThis guide shows you how to deploy a chatbot that lets you query your database using natural language. You will build a system that accepts chat messages, retains conversation history, constructs dynamic SQL queries, and returns responses generated by an AI model. By following these instructions, you will have a working solution that integrates n8nâ€™s AI Agent capabilities with MySQL.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nBefore you begin, ensure that you have the following:\n\nAn active n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud) running version 1.50.0 or later.\nValid MySQL credentials configured in n8n.\nAPI credentials for the Groq Chat Model (or your preferred AI language model).\nBasic familiarity with SQL and n8n node concepts such as chat triggers and memory buffers.\nAccess to the n8n Docs on AI Agents for further reference.\n\nWorkflow Setup\n\n1. Chat Interface & Trigger\n\nWhen Chat Message Received**  \n  This node listens for incoming chat messages via a webhook. When a message arrives, it triggers the workflow immediately.\n\n2. Conversation Memory\n\nChat History**  \n  This memory buffer node stores the last 10 interactions. It supplies conversation context to the AI Agent, ensuring that responses consider previous messages.\n\n3. AI Agent Core\n\nAI Agent (Tools Agent)**  \n  The AI Agent node orchestrates the conversation by receiving the chat input and conversation history. It dynamically generates SQL queries based on your requests and coordinates calls to external tools (such as MySQL nodes).\n\n4. Database Interactions\n\nMySQL Node**  \n  This node executes the SQL query generated by the AI Agent. You reference the query using an expression (e.g., {{$node[\"AI Agent\"].json.sql_query}}), allowing the agentâ€™s output to control data retrieval.\n\nMySQL Schema Node**  \n  This node retrieves a list of base tables from your MySQL database (excluding system schemas). The agent uses this information to understand the available tables.\n\nMySQL Definition Node**  \n  This node fetches detailed metadata (such as column names, data types, and relationships) for a specific table. The table and schema names are supplied dynamically by the AI Agent.\n\n5. Language Model Processing\n\nGroq Chat Model**  \n  This node connects to the Groq Chat API to generate text completions. It processes the combined input (chat message, context, and data fetched from MySQL) and produces the final response.\n\n6. Guidance & Customization\n\nSticky Notes**  \n  These nodes provide guidance on:\n  Switching the chat model if you wish to use another provider (e.g., OpenAI or Anthropic).\n  Adjusting the maximum token count per interaction.\n  Customizing the SQL queries and the context window size.\n  \nThey help you modify the workflow to suit your environment and requirements.\n\nWorkflow Connections\n\nThe Chat Trigger passes the incoming message to the AI Agent.\nThe Chat History node supplies conversation context to the AI Agent.\nThe AI Agent calls the MySQL nodes as external tools, generating and sending dynamic SQL queries.\nThe Groq Chat Model processes the consolidated input from the agent and outputs the natural language response delivered to the user.\n\nTesting the Workflow\n\nSend a chat message using the chat interface.\nObserve how the AI Agent processes the input and generates a corresponding SQL query.\nVerify that the MySQL nodes execute the query and return data.\nConfirm that the Groq Chat Model produces a coherent natural language response.\nRefer to the sticky notes for guidance if you need to fine-tune any node settings.\n\nNext Steps and References\n\nCustomize Your AI Model**  \n  Replace the Groq Chat Model with another language model (such as the OpenAI Chat Model) by updating the node credentials and configuration.\n\nEnhance Memory Settings**  \n  Adjust the Chat History nodeâ€™s context window to retain more or fewer messages based on your needs.\n\nModify SQL Queries**  \n  Update the SQL queries in the MySQL nodes to match your specific database schema and desired data.\n\nFurther Reading**  \n  Consult the n8n Docs on AI Agents for additional details and examples to expand your workflowâ€™s capabilities.\n\nSet Up a Website Chatbot**\n  Copy & Paste and replace the placeholders in the following code to embed the chatbot into your personal or company's website: View in CodePen ðŸ¡¥\n\nBy following these steps, you will deploy a robust AI chatbot workflow that integrates with your MySQL database, allowing you to query data using natural language.\n",
