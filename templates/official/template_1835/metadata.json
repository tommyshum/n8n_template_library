See the list of fields available in the setup below.\n\nPrerequisites\n\nNotion account and Notion credentials.\nClickUp account and ClickUp credentials.\n\nHow it works\n\nWhen a new database page is created in Notion, the workflow creates a new task in ClickUp with all required fields.\nThe new ClickUp task's ID is saved in the Notion database page's \"ClickUp ID\" field.\nThen, when the database page is updated in Notion, the workflow updates the specific ClickUp task identified by the \"ClickUp ID\" field in Notion.\n\nSetup\n\nThis workflow requires that you set up a Notion database.
